        <br>

        <p>
            This is our dog, Percy. Our dog needs to be fed and taken out twice a day. My siblings and I love our dog, but we haven’t been the best at keeping up with his daily routine. To be frank, we’ve been inconsistent and forgetful to say the least. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>
            What catapulted the need for user research within this scope started from an argument that my siblings and I had. My brother felt the rest of us were freeloaders benefiting from his hard work, I felt the way we split up Percy’s tasks wasn’t working for me, and my other siblings noted that we’d just been plain lazy. It was surprising for me to hear these varying perspectives, and I wondered if we could find a sustainable way to address all our problems. 
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <p>
            Our argument uncovered the following ideas to me:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>There were several problems at play and each of us had our own thoughts on what those problems were and how they should be solved</li>
            <li>It seemed that although each of us had varying perspectives, there was a root issue for our problems</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        
        <p>
            But our argument left me with a couple of thought-provoking questions as well:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Is forgetfulness and laziness something a solution would need to address or was that something users had to navigate for themselves?</li>
            <li>How can user research be used to account for natural, everyday mishaps like forgetfulness and lack of motivation in the first place?</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        
        <p>
            As a result, I developed the following research questions: 
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>What challenges do my family members face in taking care of our dog?</li>
            <li>How might I design a sustainable system that addresses and accounts for those problems, including but not limited to our laziness?</li>
        </ul>

        <br>
        
        <p>
            Information that is also important to note was that each of our problems directly stemmed from our own attitudes and concerns in handling Percy’s tasks. Thus, I decided interviewing my siblings would help explore those attitudes. With this emphasis in mind, I created the following interview protocol:
        </p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>In the past week, how have you completed your duties relating to Percy?</li>
            <li>How do you keep track and manage these tasks?</li>
            <li>At what times do you currently complete these tasks?</li>
            <li>What challenges do you face in completing these tasks?</li>
        </ol>

        <br>

        <p>
            The fundamental challenges/attitudes I picked up on from the interviews were…
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>My parents are irritated from having to remind people to do Percy’s tasks</li>
            <li>I am unmotivated to complete Percy’s tasks when I’m focused on completing my own responsibilities and others are completing my tasks for me</li>
            <li>Sibling #1 is annoyed that he has to do the chores that other people are responsible for</li>
            <li>Sibling #2 is conflicted because she wants to complete her tasks on time but other responsibilities like school can sometimes get in the way</li>
            <li>Sibling #3 is frustrated when people complete his job for him</li>
        </ul>

        <br>

        <p>
            I then mapped the rest of the interview observations with an Affinity Map to get an even better understanding of the problem
        </p>

        <br>

        <figure>
            <img src="images/affinity_map.png" alt="" />
            <figcaption>Affinity map of interview observations</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <br>

        <p>
            The Affinity Map highlighted that some members of my family were frustrated that others weren’t doing their work or doing their work inadequately. The members of my family who were more prone to not completing their work appropriately weren’t doing their work because other responsibilities were making it difficult to prioritze Percy’s tasks. I thus assumed that focusing on the problems of those who were more prone to not completing their work would solve problems within that group and the problems of the family members that were frustrated with those individuals. I thus started to brainstorm ideas to address those problems.
        </p>

        <br>
        
        <figure>
            <img src="images/brainstorming_map.png" alt="" />
            <figcaption>Brainstorming map used to understand problem and ideate solutions</figcaption>
        </figure>  

        <br>

        <p>
            The brainstorming activity highlighted to me that the problems of those prone to not completing their tasks were primarily a lack of motivation and a misalignment of priorities. Some effective ways I brainstormed to solve those problems were to invoke a sense of community responsibility and progress, leveraging areas where people congregate when not busy with work to remind them to do Percy’s tasks, and make the value of completing those tasks apparent. I thus realized that an effective way to solve the problem would be to create a task reminder system in the form of a progress bar that individuals could update after completing their tasks and a task bar where individuals can at a glance see what tasks still need to be completed and update which tasks were completed. This is what the progress bar and task bar looked like.
