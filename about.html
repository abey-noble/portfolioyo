        <p>Why?</p>

        <p>
            An influencer I'm inspired by lives by the mantra, "do what excites", which I think is a beautiful way to live. Recently, I've been realizing my own 
            spin on the idea in my life by "doing what I love".
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>What do I love?</p>

        <p>
            Well, I love a lot of things. I'm extremely passionate about all things UX/UI. But besides that, I love spending time outside with my friends. I enjoy acting,
            reading, and calisthenics. I love to make things, even though it at times causes a lot of discomfort, and I, simply, love to learn. Most importantly, I'm very 
            interested about mental health, education, and thinking about how to break down the problems within those spaces in our society today. 
        </p>

        <br>

        <p>What's this for?</p>
            
        <p>
            This portfolio showcases my work, mostly my experience working within UX/UI. While those experiences are a big part of me, they are not all of me. 
            As a result, this portfolio is, more simply, a showcase of all the things I'm interested in and working on because that is who I am.
